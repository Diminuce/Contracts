## Purpose

In the current technological landscape, NP problems are garnering significant attention due to their complexity in computing answers and simplicity in verifying solutions. Our project aims to create a delegated computing stage for real-world NP problems through the Aleo platform, leveraging its decentralized and privacy-preserving features.

So, why Aleo? Aleo is a decentralized and private Layer 1 blockchain that harnesses the power of advanced zk (zero-knowledge) technology to reconcile decentralization, scalability, and privacy, which are often seen as mutually exclusive. Additionally, we utilize Leo, a Rust-based Domain Specific Language (DSL) with a syntax that abstracts low-level cryptography, making it easier to express logic in zero-knowledge. This allows us to provide an environment that is not only efficient in computation but also ensures privacy for both the process and results of computations. This aspect is particularly crucial for computational tasks involving sensitive data or trade secrets. Imagine, in many commercial and scientific research fields, there is a substantial need for complex computational tasks that require fast solutions while also protecting data privacy. Our platform offers a solution for these domains, ensuring both computational efficiency and data privacy.

By integrating Aleo's advanced technology, we are committed to pioneering a new paradigm of computation. We are excited about the potential of this platform to provide decentralized delegated computing for NP problems in the future, as well as its contribution to data privacy protection.
