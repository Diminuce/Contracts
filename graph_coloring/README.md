# Graph Coloring Problem

## Introduce

[**The Graph Coloring Problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring),also known as the coloring problem,is one of the most renowned [NP-complete problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness).

Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ï¼Œ$V$ is the set of [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)),$E$ is the set of edges, the graph coloring problem involves partitioning $V$ into $K$ color groups, each forming an [independent set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_set_(graph_theory)) with no adjacent vertices. The optimization version seeks to find the smallest possible value of $K$.

The graph coloring problem is strongly associated with numerous real-world issues, such as resource allocation, minimizing circuit design, frequency assignment, and more.
